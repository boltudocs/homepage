The money raised from this NFT will be used to deveop the system to run a full marathon (42.195 km or 26.2188 miles) autonomously. If the NFT crosses US $100K we may deliver, at our option, the buyer the complete marathon video (when robot is able to drive a marathon autonomously) with full ownership. We are making this an option to make sure we can do it legally without any loss.
